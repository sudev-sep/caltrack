AI-Powered Fitness & Nutrition Tracker- CALTRACK
A modern, full-stack web application that uses Google's Gemini AI to completely simplify calorie and exercise tracking. Instead of manually searching databases and entering portion sizes, users simply type what they ate or did in natural language, and the AI handles the rest.

Key Features
AI "Smart Add" Engine: Powered by gemini-2.5-flash. Type natural language (e.g., "I ate 2 dosas" or "I ran for 3 miles") into a single input bar. The AI automatically detects if it's food or exercise, calculates the macros, and logs it.


Tech Stack
Frontend: Angular 18+ (Standalone Components), TypeScript, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5 (for responsive UI/UX).

Backend: Python, Django, Django REST Framework (DRF).

AI Integration: Google Generative AI (google-generativeai).
